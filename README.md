Docker image for the paper:
Selvi, J., RodrÃ­guez, R. J., &amp; Soria-Olivas, E. (2019). Detection of algorithmically generated malicious domain names using masked N-grams. Expert Systems with Applications, 124, 156-163.

The image has been uploaded to docker hub, so you can run it from there:
```
docker run -ti jselvi/r-masked-ngrams
```

You can also build it yourself if you prefer so:
```
docker build -t jselvi/r-masked-ngrams .
```

Finally, after a while, you should have the following results:
